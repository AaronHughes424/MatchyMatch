-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The Two main Hex colours used are #5D576B and #D7BCE8.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The "Mochiy Pop P One" font is the main font used throughout the whole website along with the "Nunito" font, with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Montserrat is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important. I created the shape imagery for the front face of the cards and the back face was take from Pixabay.com.
